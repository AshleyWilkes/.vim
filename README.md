Initial devel commit, nothing fancy and subject to possible
future rebasing.

# Installation
1) After this repo has been cloned, install Vundle plugin
and then run PluginInstall from inside vim.

# Todo notes
1) jp-based functionality (filetype.vim; ftplugin/jp_csa_log) 
should be moved to a Plugin.
2) Plugins should probably be changed into submodules
in order to provide control over which version of each
Plugin is used.
3) Settings in vimrc should be described in this README. 
Links to plugin source pages should be provided.
